# Snake Pit Puzzle – Integer Programming Formulations

This repository contains integer programming formulations for solving the **Snake Pit Puzzle**, implemented using **Gurobi 12.0.1**.

The Snake Pit puzzle is a region-division logic puzzle in which a grid must be partitioned into disjoint one-cell-wide paths ("snakes") subject to length, endpoint, and adjacency constraints.

## Contents

The repository includes:

- Multiple integer programming formulations of the puzzle
- Implementations compatible with Gurobi 12.0.1
- Experimental instances used for computational comparison

## Requirements

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Gurobi 12.0.1
- Valid Gurobi license

## Notes

These implementations are intended for research and educational purposes, particularly for studying formulation choice and comparative modelling in integer programming.
